Okay, here is the transcription:

1
00:00:00,569 --> 00:00:04,129
Speaker 1: Oh, we have a value
which is being transparent and honest.

2
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:08,679
Speaker 1: It can't be a value
written on a wall somewhere.

00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:10,009
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Uh, and if they see it everyday.

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:26,499

everything which suit our agenda and then

00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:28,549
Speaker 2: You don't want to be a hypocrite.

00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:30,219
Speaker 1: You don't want to be hypocrite.

7
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:35,509
Speaker 2: Uh, but the good thing is
if you start following some of those practices.

8
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:45,249
Speaker 2: The kind of impact it has on people,

00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:52,609
Speaker 2: Uh, like after our one year, you
know, we did like a company E and PS or something.
